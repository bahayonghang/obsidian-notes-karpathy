# Directory Structure

The vault is intentionally split into evidence, drafts, approved knowledge, and downstream outputs.

```

`outputs/reviews/` is part of the required support layer. The other output surfaces are valid parts of the full contract, but they come online when later stages need them.

`MEMORY.md` is recommended collaboration scaffolding. It should hold preferences, editorial priorities, and coordination context, not approved topic knowledge.

If the source is still on the web and has not been captured into `raw/` yet, treat browser-side collection as an upstream step. A common path is:

`web-access` or Web Clipper -> `raw/` -> `kb-ingest`

Core live indices such as `INDEX.md`, `CONCEPTS.md`, `SOURCES.md`, `RECENT.md`, and `EDITORIAL-PRIORITIES.md` belong under `wiki/live/indices/`. Optional governance views such as `QUESTIONS.md`, `GAPS.md`, and `ALIASES.md` are created only when the vault needs them.

## Ownership model

| Path | Owner | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `raw/human/**` | Human | Curated evidence intake |
| `raw/agents/{role}/**` | Agents | Untrusted captures that still need review |
| `raw/_manifest.yaml` | `kb-ingest` | Canonical source registry for tracked raw inputs |
| `MEMORY.md` | Human + agent collaboration | Preferences, editorial priorities, and coordination context |
| `raw/*.md` | `kb-compile` bootstrap input | Valid compile input during partial bootstrap, but not a replacement for the support layer |
| `wiki/drafts/**` | `kb-compile` | Reviewable summaries, topics, concepts, entities, and indices |
| `wiki/live/**` | `kb-review` promotion target | Approved long-term knowledge |
| `wiki/briefings/**` | `kb-review` | Role-specific context built from live only |
| `outputs/reviews/**` | `kb-review` | Durable review decisions |
| `outputs/qa/**` | `kb-query` | Persistent research answers |
| `outputs/content/**` | `kb-query` | Publish artifacts grounded in approved knowledge |
| `outputs/slides/**`, `outputs/reports/**`, `outputs/charts/**` | `kb-render` | Deterministic downstream artifacts |
| `outputs/web/**` | `kb-query` | Static browseable web exports from approved knowledge |
| `outputs/health/**` | `kb-review` (`maintenance` mode) | Maintenance reports |
